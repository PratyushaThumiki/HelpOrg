# HelpOrg
ImpairedHelpIndia is an app which provides knowledge about the available incentives like schemes and scholarships exclusively for physically challenged, visually impaired and hearing impaired people. Most of them don¡¯t use the facilities provided by the government because they don¡¯t know about them. This app helps them know about them and utilise the facilities to the maximum.

List the main features of your app. For example:

¡ñ Gives information regarding latest schemes and scholarships.
¡ñ Saves the important information for the user.
¡ñ The app enables RTL layout switching to support accessibility on RTL supported languages.







Further features are to be added and the work is being done.
